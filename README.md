# SpatialDock for visionOS/Apple Vision Pro
Developed by exDeveloper ([@iOS_App_Dev](https://twitter.com/iOS_App_Dev)) and PaytonDev ([@paytondev](https://twitter.com/paytondev))

# Purpose
This is for placing a dock at the bottom of your sight so that you do not have to awkwardly reach the Digital Crown of your Apple Vision Pro to launch apps.
